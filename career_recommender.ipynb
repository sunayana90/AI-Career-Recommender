      "Environmental science often involves fieldwork, requiring travel to different locations to study ecosystems, conduct research, and collect data.  This satisfies the \"traveling and exploring new places\" aspect.  Learning about environmental issues and solutions continuously provides opportunities for \"knowing new things.\" The flexibility in some environmental science roles can allow for periods of less intense work, accommodating a need for rest.  Similarly, GIS involves working with spatial data, often related to environmental issues or urban planning, requiring analysis and interpretation leading to constant learning and potentially fieldwork.
